## Abstract of the paper

We propose an adaptive sampling method for the training of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) which allows for sampling based on an arbitrary problem-specific heuristic 
which may depend on the network and its gradients. In particular we focus our analysis on the Allen-Cahn equations, attempting to accurately resolve the characteristic interfacial 
regions using a PINN without any post-hoc resampling. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of these methods over residual-adaptive frameworks.
